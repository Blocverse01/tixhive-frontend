# TixHive

TixHive is an event management platform that provides instant revenue to event organizers and gives them 100% control over primary and secondary ticket sales.

## How it works 

Events on TixHive are published as ERC721 NFT collections on Polygon, with each ticket minted as a unique token, and a customized SVG with a QRCode and metadata is generated for each ticket during mint, this SVG and NFT metadata is then stored on IPFS. These tickets also give event organizers the superpowers they need to build token-gated and exclusive communities.
